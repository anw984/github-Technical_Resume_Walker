My Name is Andrew Walker and I'm a student at The University of Tulsa. 
I've spent the last 4 years learning everything relating to the Information Technology industry -- from object-oriented programming,  to SQL databases, and cybersecurity. 
I'm currently applying this knowledge in my role as a Service Center Trainer for QuikTrip Corporation, where I'm responsible for      writing knowledge articles, performing initial and ongoing training for analysts, and collaborating with developers to align our     processes.
